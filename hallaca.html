        <span><p style="color: yellow;">The <em>Hallaca</em> is the prime Christmas/New Years Eve dinner,</span><span style="color: blue;"> this one requires quite some stuff to elaborate it, but it is worthy.</span> <span style="color: red;">This one includes the following:</p></span>

        <strong><em>Now onto the preparation:</em></strong>
        <br><br>

        <ol>
           <li> Clean and cut the leaves as instructed below. You can do this the day before. Make sure you buy frozen or smoked banana leaves. The fresh ones will break when wrapping.</li>
           <li>Make the Onoto Oil. The oil needs time to cool down, so I like to make it the day before. Make sure you don't boil the oil, or it will be bitter.</li>
           <li>Make the Broth. Cook the meats with lots of veggies to produce a very tasty broth, which will be used to make the guiso and masa.</li>
           <li>Make the Guiso. Make sure your guiso is not too runny. Read my tip to thicken the guiso below.</li>
           <li>Make the Masa. To make the masa, you will need the onoto oil and the broth you cooked the meats in.</li>
           <li>Prepare the Adornos. This is when the traditions of each family come to light! Each region of Venezuela has its own version of adornos, which can range from slices of eggs, and bacon, to chickpeas. Feel free to add whatever your family likes. Having all the topping ready to go make the assembling process so much easy.</li>
           <li>Assemble the Hallacas. Make sure to check out my step-by-step photos below.</li>
           <li>Cook. You probably will need to cook the hallacas in batches. Make sure that the hallacas are fully submerged in water for even cooking.</li>    
        </ol>
