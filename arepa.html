        <span><p style="color: yellow;">The <em>Arepa</em> is probably the most popular and therefore,</span> <span style="color: blue;"> most common meal in the country.</span> <span style="color: red;">This one includes the following:</p></span>

        <br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as Harina P.A.N.®)</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        

        <br><br>
        <br>
        <strong><em>Now onto the preparation:</em></strong>
        <br><br>

        <ol>
           <li> Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
           <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
           <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
           <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
           <li>Add whatever you may please, be it Ham, Cheese, etc... and enjoy!</li>    
        </ol>
